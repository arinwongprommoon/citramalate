Testing the DE algorithm on couples
2018-07-12
Chose GLT and ATP_MAINTENANCE because the 0.1-1.0 and the 0.1-10.0 heatmaps
suggest different maxima in their areas.

Parameters used: Mut = 0.8, CR = 0.3, N = 20, generations = 20
(following Storn's 'rules of thumb' for the DE algorithm)

These are results of four runs using these parameters:
      wild type productivity = 0.00112225918623
      (displayed as 11.2 in heatmaps)

Here I increase the number of generations to 40.
The algorithms locks itself to a different minimum, and there is less variation 
in the Vmax values found, but the variation is still quite substantial.

Compare this with higher-resolution heatmaps of GLT and ATP_MAINTENANCE.
