    A whole slew of fluxes in the negative 1e-19 ~ 1e-17, plus one in 1e-9 and
    1e-5, so these can perhaps be safely discounted, but there's H2Otpp equal to
    -0.78. It IS possible to have these values be negative, and the overall
    solution (productivity) is positive, so it's fine...? Look into this later

    This is... ten times as much productivity as 1d boundaries... how??
    
    Smaller collection of negative -1e-19 values and bits of -18, -16, -8, all
    of which can possibly be ignored. H2Otpp is -2.93
