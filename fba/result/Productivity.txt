    EX_glc_LPAREN_e_RPAREN_ bounds make solution infeasible
    (-0.5463636363636376), removed it to produce the above

1d boundaries

0.5459307075521895 (optimal)
Subsequent runs:

Re-mapping malate dehydrogenases does not affect this result.
Enriching this with good boundaries found by 6d returned:
    0.5459307075521898
    That was useful...

Okay, today is just what-the-fuck upon what-the-fucks....
    
*** negative values of fluxes actually do not necessarily
    automatically make the solver status infleasible, because that also happens
    with the old boundaries.
    
    
*** re-mapping malate dehydrogenases does not change any results or behaviour
