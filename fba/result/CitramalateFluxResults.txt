    pretty much exactly the same as 1d even though some are replaced by 7d
    what the hell....
    
*** negative values of fluxes actually do not necessarily
    automatically make the solver status infleasible, because that also happens
    with the old boundaries.

(interestingly the flux increases here, but ever so slightly...)
