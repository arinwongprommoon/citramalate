Old boundaries
2018-07-26 afternoon
0.30666662241994413
    EX_glc_LPAREN_e_RPAREN_ fixed to -0.23 (was +0.23 orignally, and caused problems)

1d boundaries
2018-07-26 afternoon
0.24126783510010835 (optimal)

4d boundaries
2018-07-26 afternoon  
COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE

5d boundaries
2018-07-26 afternoon
COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE
    
6d boundaries

7d boundaries
2018-07-26 afternoon
0.03568578471111086 (optimal) - no idea why it's lower than 6d

'Frankenstein' boundaries
    (taking the best lower bounds and upper bounds from 1d, 4d-7d)

0.2412678351001083 (optimal)
    pretty much exactly the same as 1d even though some are replaced by 7d
    what the hell....
    
*** negative values of fluxes actually do not necessarily
    automatically make the solver status infleasible, because that also happens
    with the old boundaries.

7d boundaries (note this uses a different list of reactions in the DE, based on the flux control coefficients)

ADDING CONSTRAINTS TO GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND PPP

7d boundaries (derived from above)
(2018-07-31)
0.17312322210000042 
(interestingly the flux increases here, but ever so slightly...)

0.1875014743555557
(alternate set of 7d boundaries found by running the scripts again)
as expected

0.1874652219843159
(another alternate set of 7d boundaries)

'Frankenstein' of 1D+7D+7D
0.2623063738070584
measurable increase but not very impressive (well, it's 0.9%...)

'Frankenstein' of 1D+7D+7D+7D
0.2623189049346125
pretty much no increase from the last Frankenstein

CORRECTED MAPPING FOR GLUCOSE AND ACETATE EXCHANGE

Anargyros's boundaries
    note: take the flux values he found and put in sheet 2 and mapped them to reactions according to my corrected mapping

7d boundaries, 5 generations, alternate set 1 (the 2018-07-31 set, but re-mapped because Anargyros is a git)
(2018-08-01)

7d boundaries, 10 generations
(2018-08-01)
0.1919469906857141
    increase, but not very good. It's a 2.3% increase
    
8d boundaries, 5 generations
(2018-08-01)
0.1924651396176814
    yeah that's better than 7d after 10 generations
    will just keep adding enzymes in my free time
    
46d boundaries, 5 generations
(2018-08-02)
0.2917185323901061
    most of the mins are pretty much 0, unlike the 8d boundaries, so
    I doubt the authenticity of this
    
+ exchange reactions constrained according to lund
1d
glc = -0.23: 0.2676265673163718
glc = -0.68: 0.5582743016411907
(2018-08-03)
glc = -10.0: 0.7813046236586969
feed equal to concentration multiplied by growth rate (mu) of 0.1 h-1: infeasible
everything in the lund medium = -10.0: 4.890173808719396 (this is interesting)
everything in the lund medium = -1000: 4.978473050910305 (huh...)
