    EX_glc_LPAREN_e_RPAREN_ fixed to -0.23 (was +0.23 orignally, and caused problems)

0.03568578471111086 (optimal) - no idea why it's lower than 6d

'Frankenstein' boundaries
    (taking the best lower bounds and upper bounds from 1d, 4d-7d)

0.2412678351001083 (optimal)
    pretty much exactly the same as 1d even though some are replaced by 7d
    what the hell....
    
*** negative values of fluxes actually do not necessarily
    automatically make the solver status infleasible, because that also happens
    with the old boundaries.

7d boundaries (derived from above)
(2018-07-31)
0.17312322210000042 
(interestingly the flux increases here, but ever so slightly...)

0.1875014743555557
(alternate set of 7d boundaries found by running the scripts again)
as expected

'Frankenstein' of 1D+7D+7D
0.2623063738070584
measurable increase but not very impressive (well, it's 0.9%...)

'Frankenstein' of 1D+7D+7D+7D
0.2623189049346125
pretty much no increase from the last Frankenstein
