Decided that:
    Kinetic model MDH = Stoichiometric model MDH
    Kinetic model MQO = Stoichiometric model MDH2
    
This conflicts with the 'old boundaries' in Mapping_Kinetic_Mendes_Stoc_Palsson_Optimized.ods,
and any new files created will follow my mapping above, with commit logs
reflecting this
