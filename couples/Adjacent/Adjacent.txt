Generating heatmaps for pairs of enzymes adjacent to each other in a pathway
2018-07-13

Focused on the 0.1-1.0 range because it is the most informative.

Pairs:
Glycolytic pathway
    - PGI and PFK -> no special effect observed
    - GPM and ENO -> some synergistic effect, but not very pronounced. Location
                     still pretty much where it is expected
    - FBA and GDH

Tricarboxylic acid cycle/Glyoxylate pathway
    - ACEA and ACEB

    
== MORE DETAILS ==

- GPM and ENO

wt = 11.22
GPM(0.1V) = 12.59
ENO(0.1V) = 14.40
Predicted = 15.77 (=11.22 + (12.59-11.22) + (14.40-11.22) )
Actual = 16.26

Conclusion: some synergistic effect

- FBA and GDH

FBA(21.70) = 11.22
GDH(4.33) = 14.85
Predicted = 14.85
Actual = 14.85

Conclusion: no synergistic effect, or inconclusive as FBA exerts so little 
            effect
            
- ACEA and ACEB

ACEA(0.1V) = 22.70
ACEB(0.1V) = 14.91
Predicted = 25.49
Actual = 23.13

Conclusion: antagonistic effect?!

** Control with old plots:

- ACEA and ZWF

ACEA(0.1V) = 22.70
ZWF(0.1V) = 13.79
Predicted = 25.27
Actual = 25.74

Conclusion: probably no synergistic effect

- GLT and GDH

GLT(57.06) = 11.22
GDH(4.33) = 14.85
Predicted = 14.85
Actual = 14.85

Conclusion: no synergistic effect

- LPD and GDH

LPD(0.01) = 93.87
GDH(5.20) = 14.68
Predicted = 97.33
Actual = 107.30

Conclusion: synergistic effect!


What I learn from this: playing with two enzymes that are adjacent in a pathway
doesn't really result in much of a difference compared to two enzymes in
completely different locations in the network
Will probably conduct more rigorous analysis later
