Ideas I have while writing the report about improving the report

MAIN REPORT -> looks like it will be 20-30 pages long (not that surprising though)
- Instead of putting lists of enzymes as footnotes, move them to the appendix?
- Add original list and FCC list to the appendix
- Name the original list using a name that is informative

EXPERIMENTS
- Prepare a minmax.ods using standard deviations over 0.1-1.0??? (this will necessitate re-generating a lot of plots and re-running a lot of experiments)
