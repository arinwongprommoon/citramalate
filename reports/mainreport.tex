\begin{abstract}
  Using living organisms to synthesise chemicals is an alternative to synthesising chemicals from fossil fuels, as it serves as a renewable resource with potentially high efficiency and low cost. The procedures can be sped up by optimising conditions using mathematical models. Citramalate ((2S)-2-Hydroxy-2-methylbutanedioate) is a chemical of industrial interest as it can be a precursor for methacrylic acid, a monomer for the production of plastics. 
  
  The project aimed to find conditions to maximise the production of citramalate using modelling approaches. In this project, an existing kinetic model for \emph{E. coli} metabolism was extended by adding a reaction that produces citramalate from acetyl coenzyme A and pyruvate. \emph{E. coli} was chosen as the model organism as its metabolism is very well characterised in the literature. The project employed Python and libraries specific to genetic algorithms, modelling, and manipulating information presented in SBML (systems biology markup language).
  
  First, the effect of $V_{max}$ values of enzymes in the kinetic model~\cite{millard_metabolic_2017} on productivity of citramalate was investigated. $V_{max}$ values were chosen as a parameter as it can be easily tested \emph{in vivo} by relying on the principle that $V_{max}$ is proportional to enzyme concentration. The differential evolution genetic algorthim was then employed to compute the set of $V_{max}$ values of enzymes that optimises the production of citramalate, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
  
  In the second part of the project, information from the kinetic model was used to enrich the stoichiometric model~\cite{orth_comprehensive_2011}. More specifically, information about the possible values of fluxes through each reaciton was used to set the boundaries for each reaction in a stoichiometric model. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was then performed to evaluate the highest possible flux through the citramalate-producing reaction as a proxy for citramalate productivity. The composition of the Lund medium~\cite{eastham_process_2015} was studied in an attempt to create boundaries for relevant uptake reactions.
  
  The project took place at the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, Department of Biochemistry, in Prof Steve Oliver's group. Research associate Dr Jorge J\'ulvez supervised me throughout the project. The project was entirely computational, and ran from 25 June 2018 to 17 August 2018.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

The project concerns two models of \emph{E. coli} metabolism: a kinetic model described by Millard \emph{et al} in 2017~\cite{millard_metabolic_2017} and a stoichiometric model described by Orth \emph{et al} in 2011~\cite{orth_comprehensive_2011}. The kinetic model concerns a smaller set of reactions than the stoichiometric model, but it contains information about initial conditions (substrate concentrations and flux through reactions) which the stoichiometric model lacks.

The kinetic model contains 68 reactions, 49 of which include $V_{max}$ as a parameter. Of these, 41\footnote{ACEA, ACEB, ACK, ACN\_1, ACN\_2, ACS, ATP\_syn, CITRA\_SYN, CYTBO, EDA, EDD, ENO, FBA, FBP, FUMA, GDH, GLT, GND, GPM, LPD, MAD, MDH, MQO, PCK, PDH, PFK, PGI, PGK, PGL, PIT, PPC, PPS, PTA, PYK, RPE, RPI, SDH, SK, SQR, TPI, and ZWF} correspond to real enzyme-catalyzed reactions in \emph{E. coli}. To investigate citramalate production, a 69th reaction called CITRA\_SYN was added to the model. It models the reaction:

\begin{center}
  acetyl-CoA + pyruvate + \ce{H2O} $\rightarrow$ CoA-SH + \ce{H^+} + citramalate
\end{center}

with the kinetic law

\[
  \frac{\mathrm{d}[citramalate]}{\mathrm{d}t} = 
  \frac{V_{max} \cdot [acetyl-CoA]}{[acetyl-CoA] + K_{m}}
\]

assuming pyruvate is saturating. The $V_{max}$ is set to 4 mM s\textsuperscript{-1} and $K_{m}$ to 0.495 mM in the modified model.

Citramalate productivity is defined as $\mu Y_{P/S}$, where $\mu$ is the growth rate in reciprocal time units (h\textsuperscript{-1} in this project) and $Y_{P/S}$ is defined as mass of product over mass of substrate, which is glucose in this context. Manipulating the SBML file required the Python library \texttt{libsbml} and running simulations employed the \texttt{roadrunner} module. Throughout the project, the simulations were from 0 to 7,200 seconds, at which steady-state is attained for almost all the conditions (also see section~\vref{sec:couples}) %change this to a subsection investigating steady-state later

The stoichiometric model contains 2,584 reactions, and I have mapped 57 of them to their equivalents in the kinetic model (more details in section~\vref{sec:mapping}). By default, most of these reactions are unbounded (Orth \emph{et al}~\cite{orth_comprehensive_2011} provided details about this). In a similar vein to the kinetic model, a 2,585th reaction for citramalate production was added to the stoichiometric model using the COBRA module in Python. However, no kinetic parameters were added, as stoichiometric models do not contain this information. In addition to the citramalate synthesis reaction, a sink reaction to allow citramalate to leave the system was also added.

\chapter{Investigating the kinetic model}
\label{ch:kinetic}

%(Maybe write the purpose of doing this here? But I think the abstract and the introduction suffice)

\section{Varying $V_{max}$ values of one reaction at a time}
\label{sec:onereac}

Here I investigated the relationship between the value of $V_{max}$ of each reaction in the kinetic model and the resulting citramalate productivity at steady state -- i.e.\ after two hours. I varied the $V_{max}$ values of each of the 49 reactions\footnote{ACEA, ACEB, ACK, ACN\_1, ACN\_2, ACS, ATP\_MAINTENANCE, ATP\_syn, CITRA\_SYN, CYTBO, EDA, EDD, ENO, FBA, FBP, FUMA, GDH, GLT, GND, GPM, GROWTH, LPD, MAD, MDH, MQO, NADH\_req, NDHII, PCK, PDH, PFK, PGI, PGK, PGL, PIT, PPC, PPS, PTA, PYK, RPE, RPI, SDH, SK, SQR, TPI, XCH\_ACE1, XCH\_ACE2, XCH\_GLC, XCH\_ZWF} in the kinetic model that include $V_{max}$ as a parameter. The ranges 0.1--1.0 $V_{max}$ and 0.1--10.0 $V_{max}$, where $V_{max}$ is the wild-type $V_{max}$ for that particular reaction as specified in the SBML file. I used 100 data points for each plot. Figure~\ref{fig:onereacsample} is an example of such a plot.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{onereacsample}
  \caption{Example of a one-reaction plot: the reaction PYK}
  \label{fig:onereacsample}
\end{figure}

For some enzymes, varying $V_{max}$ values have a greater effect on citramalate productivity than others. I quantified this effect based on the data points of the 0.5 -- 2.0 $V_{max}$ plots\footnote{created early in the project, not included in the final results. I only mention them here because I used information from them in later parts of the project} as follows:

\[
effect = \frac{(max - min)}{(0.5 \cdot (max + min)}
\]

This is the difference between the maximum and minimum productivities obtained over the range, relative to the average, which represents where the value of productivity is. I intended to find the extent of variation from the `typical' value of productivity around this range. Granted, this isn’t the best way to analyse. I’ve tried regression, but it didn’t seem very informative.

This identified CITRA\_SYN, GLT, LPD, GROWTH, ATP\_MAINTENANCE, GDH, ATP\_SYN, ACEA, PYK, and ZWF as among the enzymes that had the greatest effects. Millard \emph{et al}~\cite{millard_metabolic_2017} listed CYTBO, ZWF, GDH, GLT, and GROWTH as the enzymes found to have the largest shares of flux control. They also exert the strongest controls on concentration. These enzymes are followed by LPD, ATP\_MAINTENANCE, ACEA, ATP\_SYN, and PYK

Exchange reactions (XCH\_ACE, XCH\_GLC, and XCH\_P) have no bearing on productivity as all the values in their plots can be attributed to noise. Surprisingly, ACS (acetyl CoA synthetase), ACK (acetate kinase), and PTA (phosphate acetyltransferase), which are all directly related to controlling acetyl CoA levels, do not seem to have ignificant bearings on productivity.

As expected, enzymes found to have the largest shares of flux control create the plots that demonstrate the greatest change in citramalate productivity in response to $V_{max}$ changes. However, CYTBO has a less effect on productivity as would be expected by this explanation. Although PYK does not exert a lot of control over fluxes as expected by its flux control coefficient, it has quite a great effect on citramalate productivity. Possibly it is because the citramalate reaction uses up pyruvate and because PYK is a control point in glycolysis. A few reactions exhibit inflection points in their plots, as shown in table~\ref{tab:inflection}. For reference, the wild-type productivity is 0.001122 h\textsuperscript{-1}. %0.00112225918623

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Reactions with inflection points}
  \label{tab:inflection}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lrrl}
    Reaction & $V_{max}$ (mM s\textsuperscript{-1}) & Productivity (h\textsuperscript{-1}) & Type\\
    ATP\_syn & 16.804 & 0.00216 & minimum\\
    & 23.724 & 0.00231 & maximum\\
    CITRA\_SYN & 0.545 & 0.01660 & maximum\\
    CYTBO & 5.124 & 0.00113 & maximum\\
    EDA & 0.014 & 0.00112 & maximum\\

    PFK & 0.145 & 0.00113 & maximum
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition to the list of reactions ordered by effect on citramalate productivity as described earlier, I also extracted a list of reactions arranged by descending order of flux control coefficent (FCC) from the Millard \emph{et al} paper, and used it alongside this list in later parts of the project.

\section{Varying $V_{max}$ values of two reactions at a time}
\label{sec:couples}

Varying $V_{max}$ values of two reactions at a time aimed to identify pairs of reactions that have significant effects on citramalate productivity, which could be used to identify conditions that optimise citramalate productivity. Ideally, one should look at all pairs from the 49 reactions that have $V_{max}$ as a parameter. However, there are such 1,176 pairs, and extrapolating from my experience, it would take about nine hours to run the simulations needed to generate the data points using the conditions used in the project. Furthermore, for most reactions, the change in citramalate productivity was minimal when $V_{max}$ varied over the range of 0.1--10.0 $V_{max}$, so generating such a number of datasets would produce a large amount of useless information.

Therefore, I used only the eight reactions from the top of the list I prepared in section~\ref{sec:onereac}, namely:  CITRA\_SYN, GLT, LPD, ATP\_MAINTENANCE, GDH, ATP\_syn, ACEA, and ZWF. I varied their $V_{max}$ values within 0.1--1.0 $V_{max}$ or 0.1--10.0 $V_{max}$, and plotted the resulting citramalate productivities on 28 heatmaps. The $V_{max}$ values took 10 values in their ranges, so each heatmap had 100 data points. The horizontal axis indicates the absolute $V_{max}$ value of the first reaction in mM s\textsuperscript{-1} and the vertical axis represents the second reaction. So that the numbers that are easily visualised are displayed at each data point, I multiplied the citramalate productivity in h\textsuperscript{-1} by 10,000, as the wild-type productivity is 0.001122. Figure~\ref{fig:heatmapsample} is an example of a heatmap. Here, when the $V_{max}$ of GLT is 256.76 mM s\textsuperscript{-1} and the $V_{max}$ of ACEA is 1.83 mM s\textsuperscript{-1}, productivity is 0.00848.

I also used the reactions with the 10 greatest flux control coefficients to generate heatmaps. The trends seen in most heatmaps suggest simple additive effects, and the heatmaps do not have any additional local maxima or minima, suggesting orthogonality.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{heatmapsample}
  \caption{Example of a heatmap: GLT vs ACEA}
  \label{fig:heatmapsample}
\end{figure}

Plots that involve ATP\_MAINTENANCE exhibit strange behaviour, more evident in higher-resolution heatmaps like figure~\ref{fig:atpmaintenanceheatmap}. The source of this behaviour is unexpected behaviour shown between 0.20 and 0.25 $V_{max}$ in ATP\_MAINTENANCE's one-reaction plot (figure~\ref{fig:atpmaintenanceonereac}). Jorge suggests that it’s because the model is not equipped to deal with small values of $V_{max}$.

  \caption{One-reaction plot for ATP\_MAINTENANCE, 300 data points}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Verifying that the system has reached steady-state}
\label{ssec:steadystate}

The results are only valid if the system has reached steady state. Steady state is achieved if at the end of simulation time, the greatest rate of change of concentration among the species in the system is less than a small threshold value. In other words:

\[
  \max_{X_{i}} \left | \frac{\mathrm{d}[X_{i}]}{\mathrm{d}t} \right | < \epsilon
\]

where X represents a chemical species, and $\epsilon$ is the threshold value. The threshold value was intially set at \num{1.0e-8}, but then adjusted to \num{1.0e-6} following inspection of heatmaps. For ease of visualisation, I generated heatmaps as I did earlier, but with data points replaced by -1 if the system does not reach steady state in those particular situations (see figure~\ref{fig:steadystate})

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{steadystate}
  \caption{Heatmap for ATP\_MAINTENANCE vs ZWF, with threshold set to \num{1.0e-8}}
  \label{fig:steadystate}
\end{figure}

% Make this a paragraph?
I noticed that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ATP, ADP, P, and Hout are among the species that break the \num{1.0e-8} threshold. However, they stay at around \num{1.0e-7}.
  \item ATP\_MAINTENANCE at 0.1 $V_{max}$ produced rates on the order of \num{e-1}, and ATP\_syn at 0.1 $V_{max}$ produced rates on the order of \num{e-2}. With these two reactions, the species responsible are BPG and OAA
  \item GDH at 0.1 $V_{max}$ produced rates on the order of \num{e-3}, with GLCx and GLCp responsible. This is the only situation where GLCx and GLCp concentrations do not reach steady state.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synergistic effects}
\label{ssec:synergistic}

It was difficult to determine if there are synergistic effects between reactions. I began by investigating reactions adjacent to each other. No special effects were observed for PGI and PFK, and a slight synergistic effect was observed for GPM and ENO. Between FBA and GDH, FBA exerts too little effect for the results to be conclusive. In contrast, ACEA and ACEB exhibit \emph{antagonistic} effects, and LPD and GDH, a pair of enzymes far apart from each other in the network seem to have a synergistic effect. My investigations are in the appendix. %insert reference here

\section{Using differential evolution}
\label{sec:de}

% Find way to cite Mier
Differential evolution is a genetic algorithm developed by Storn and Price~\cite{storn_differential_1997}. I used the \texttt{rand/1/bin} strategy, adapting code by Pablo R. Mier (\url{https://pablormier.github.io/2017/09/05/a-tutorial-on-differential-evolution-with-python/}). I used the algorithm to maximise the citramalate productivity while multiple enzymes in a list are varied in their $V_{max}$ values simultaneously.

Differential evolution has the following parameters: $F$, the mutation constant or differential weight; $CR$, the recombination constant or crossover probability, $NP$, the population size; and $D$, the number of dimensions and the number of enzymes investigated simultaneously. The number of iterations is also specified.

Using default values of the parameters, in identifying the $V_{max}$ values of pairs of reactions that resulted in maximal productivity, differential evolution agrees with heatmaps. Occasionally, it discovers maxima not seen in the heatmaps, owing to the relatively low resolution of the heatmaps.

\subsection{Finding optimal parameters}
\label{ssec:deoptimise}

I tested how well the optimal differential evolution parameter values quoted by Storn and Price (1997)~\cite{storn_differential_1997} and Pedersen (2010)~\cite{pedersen_good_2010} optimised citramalate productivity. I used enzymes in the glycolytic pathway (refer to subsection~\vref{ssec:glycolytic}) and enzymes in the list I made in chapter~\vref{sec:onereac}. Values were chosen based on algorithm run time and how fast convergence is realised. They are presented in table~\vref{tab:deoptimise}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Differential evolution optimal parameter search}
  \label{tab:deoptimise}
  \centering
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{LLLLLLL}
    $F$ & $CR$ & $NP$ & iterations & $D$ & Source\\
    0.8 & 0.7 & 20 & & 2-3 & Mier\\
    0.8 & 0.7 & 20 & 25-40 & 5 & Mier\\
    0.6 & 0.9 & \textless 40 & \textgreater 20 & 5 & Storn\\
    0.6301 & 0.7122 & 17 & 50 & 6-7 & Pedersen (D = 5)\\
    0.6301 & 0.7122 & 17 & 70 & 7 & Pedersen (D = 5)\\
    0.6607 & 0.9426 & 28 & 50 & 7-10 & Pedersen (D = 10, first set), best\\
    0.6702 & 0.2368 & 12 & 100 & 7 & Pedersen (D = 10, second set)\\
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

% This subsection may be moved to the appendix or disappear altogether. It's kind of a side-project, and does not really contribute much to the report. Furthermore, this contributes nothing to the methods.
\subsection{Glycolytic enzymes}
\label{ssec:glycolytic}

Originally I used differential evolution with the set of glycolytic enzymes PGI, PFK, FBA, GDH, PGK, GPM, ENO, PYK, and PDH to investigate whether the $V_{max}$ values of all enzymes in a pathway have to be increased to obtain an appreciable increase in the overall flux through the pathway, resulting in higher productivity. Niederberger \emph{et al}~\cite{niederberger_strategy_1992} stated in their paper that flux through all enzymes in a linear pathway must be increased for flux through the pathway to be increased, judging by their experiments on the tryptophan synthesis pathway in yeast. However, Yamamoto \emph{et al}~\cite{yamamoto_overexpression_2012} stated otherwise, and showed that appreciable increases resulted after increasing the flux through only one or two enzymes. My results support the latter.

The objective changed to investigating how much adding an enzyme as an additional dimension in the differential evolution algorithm affects productivity. Adding enzymes relatively low on the section~\ref{sec:onereac} list does not affect the optimum $V_{max}$ values already on there much, and does not cause large improvements in productivity.

%insert appropriate reference to memory leak later
%also make language more formal
This is good because it does not seem necessary to include all enzymes in a pathway in differential evolution, which is a good solution for the memory leak in \texttt{roadrunner}. Additionally, the `curse of dimensionality' results in exponential increases in the time required to return solutions as reactions are added. So it was worth finding out with enzymes had the most effects on productivity after all.

\subsection{Optimisation of citramalate production}
\label{ssec:optcitra}

Used the best parameters on differential evolution on the set of seven enzymes: CITRA\_SYN, GLT, LPD, GDH, ATP\_syn, ACEA, ZWF

F = 0.6607, CR = 0.9426, NP = 28, generations = 50

(Insert table for 7 citra enzymes here)

Productivity = 353.66 10-4

Confirmed that DE is useful: took values expected to generate the highest productivity as expected from one-reaction plots alone and plugged them into the model, then used comproducti() to evaluate productivity. Turns out to be 226.96. Conclusion: DE is useful.

Tried it on 10 enzymes - CITRA\_SYN, GLT, LPD, GDH, ATP\_syn, ACEA, PYK, ZWF, NDHII, MQO -- achieved 405.5 productivity, but values swing.

(Insert table for 10 citra enzymes from the old de report here)

\chapter{Enriching the stoichiometric model}
\label{ch:stoich}

An Anargyros who used to work with this group mapped reactions between the kinetic model described by Millard et al (2017) and the stoichiometric model by Orth et al (2011). He took into account reactions that were reversed with respect to each other and differing stoichiometries. He produced a mapping table, sub-network diagrams, and lower/upper limits for fluxes of each reaction common to both models. The focus was more on mapping and he didn’t put specific constraints while generating the lower/upper limits, and the method by which he generated these values was not documented.

Flux balance analysis is employed, and aims to find an optimal solution for an objective reaction (e.g.\ flux of citramalate synthesis reaction) subject to constraints to the possible flux values. Essentially this is linear programming. Orth et al (2010) wrote a good explanation (add reference here)

Reconciling unit differences

In the kinetic model, units of flux through each reaction are in mM s-1, while it is mmol gDW-1 h-1 in the stoichiometric model. Taking into account the cell volume of 1.77e-3 L gDW-1as specified in the kinetic model, I’ve worked out that to convert the units from the kinetic model to the stoichiometric model, multiply by 6.372.

Because of this relationship and the fact that the stoichiometric model does not have any information of enzyme kinetics, I can safely use numbers with kinetic model units on the structure of the stoichiometric network, and if necessary, apply the unit conversion at any time (or never at all)

\section{Mapping reactions in the kinetic model to the stoichiometric model}
\label{sec:mapping}

Steal stuff from the mapping report. Mostly repeat that. Not sure if I intended the main report to have more or less detail than the mapping report -- my memory is horseshit.

\section{Creating boundaries for FBA}
\label{sec:bounds}

Aim: finding the minimum and maximum of the fluxes through the 68 reactions in the kinetic model (69 for the version with citramalate added) by varying the $V_{max}$ values of the 49 enzymes with $V_{max}$ as a parameter.

Ideally: vary all 49 at once, but computational memory and time is limited, so I have devised two strategies to produce educated guesses for the lower and upper limits of the flux values. The broader the boundaries, the better they are.

A) Varying one enzyme at a time

B) Varying many enzymes at a time using differential evolution to obtain minimum and maximum values.

First method: varying one enzyme at a time. Found by varying the $V_{max}$ values of one enzyme at a time over the range of 0.1-10.0 $V_{max}$ in a modification of the Millard et al (2017) kinetic model, namely, with the citramalate reaction added

Varying many enzymes (will just not mention 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D as its unnecessary)

8D: Use original list. CYTBO, MQO, MDH, ZWF, GLT, GDH, ATP\_syn, ACK. Over range of 0.3 -- 10.0 $V_{max}$ because of CVODE. Say something about $V_{max}$ not reliable in this region anyway. State DE parameters. Maybe put the boundaries in the appendix.

41D: List of all enzymes. Over 0.4 -- 10.0 because CVODE. State DE parameters.

\section{Flux balance analysis}
\label{sec:fba}

Add results from CitraFluxResults.txt here -- easier just to write it \emph{de novo} instead of Frankensteninig sentences from different report files/Evernote.

Then, instead of using the flux through the citramalate reaction as the objective function in the FBA, I looped through all 2,585 reactions in the model and used each as an objective function, for both the minimising and maximising senses. The results are (of course) in large CSV files.

First I used the boundaries that were included in the stoichiometric model (i.e. no constraints), then applied the 41D boundaries. The optimal minimum and maximum values will be used to create a further set of constraints for each reaction in the stoichiometric model later.

\section{Investigating glucose uptake}
\label{sec:glucoseuptake}

For reference, this is a mapping between the relevant reactions that I settled on.

(Insert table showing mapping here)

First, I looked at the relationship between the glucose feed and the fluxes through the other reactions in the kinetic model. The fluxes through XCH\_GLC and the PTS\_X reactions are always the same. XCH\_GLC is equal to GLC\_feed from GLC\_feed = 0 to GLC\_feed = 0.68, after which XCH\_GLC never increases above 0.68 (saturation).

With increasing GLC\_feed, GLCx and GLCp concentrations remain very low until GLC\_feed = 0.68, after which they increase linearly as GLC\_feed increases. The concentration of G6P increases linearly until GLC\_feed = 0.68, at which it immediately plateaus at 3.19

\section{Using information from the Lund medium}
\label{sec:lund}

As specified on page 79 of the patent WO 2015/022496, a medium for E. coli BW25113 $\Delta{}pflB\Delta{}ldhA$ transformed with pBAD24-cimA fermentation for the optimal production of (R)-citramalic acid has the composition:

Insert composition in table form here

I calculated the ratios between the moles of each species present in this recipe (will make it into a more presentable format later):

With these ratios, I applied them as bounds (strictly lower bounds, but they represent the maximum rate of uptake because of sign conventions used by the model) for the relevant exchange reactions in the stoichiometric model, fixing glucose feed bound to -0.23, -0.68, and -10.0. The model has exchange reactions for all the above species except for EDTA, and I merged the phosphoric acid derivatives into one ‘phosphates’ species for the model.

Only the glucose and citrate exchange reaction appears in the flux values in the optimal solution. Upon totally unbounding all these exchange reactions (some are bound to 0 in the default model), glucose exchange is -11.13 and citrate exchange is -1.20
