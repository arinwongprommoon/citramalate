Plans for `Extended Report'

1. Make the existing language more readable

2. Expand on the existing content:
   - Provide reason and rationale for the use of various values, reactions, etc
   - Add more citations
   - Expand on the introduction, make it more like an introduction to a paper
     (this should be a slight change)
   
3. Add new content:
   - Work on the Lund medium and unit conversions
   - Work on calculating citramalate productivity
     (reconciling with ConBioChem and Wu & Eiteman 2016)
   - Work on analysing bounds
   - Work on FVA and pFBA
   
4. Add a discussion section:
   - Sum up findings and relate them to existing literature, e.g. 
       - Wu & Eiteman 2016, regarding genes to be knocked out to boost
         citramalate productivity
       - Millard et al, regarding FCC values

5. Overhaul remarks section
   - mainly because I've managed to solve some of the issues
   - provide rationale for why I haven't addressed some of them
     (e.g. not using Gurobi/CPLEX because the function is convex, and thinking
     of using flexible nets instead)
   - provide *new* future issues
   
6. Add more stuff to appendix so that it can be read stand-alone
   - mapping: incorporate the mapping report and the mapping spreadsheet
     (somehow)
   - more?
   
7. Improve abstract -- make it shorter and summarise results better
   Notes about where the internship was should be in some extra section
