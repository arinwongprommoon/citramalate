	abstract = {The initial genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli K-12 {MG}1655 was assembled in 2000. It has been updated and periodically released since then based on new and curated genomic and biochemical knowledge. An update has now been built, named {iJO}1366, which accounts for 1366 genes, 2251 metabolic reactions, and 1136 unique metabolites. {iJO}1366 was (1) updated in part using a new experimental screen of 1075 gene knockout strains, illuminating cases where alternative pathways and isozymes are yet to be discovered, (2) compared with its predecessor and to experimental data sets to confirm that it continues to make accurate phenotypic predictions of growth on different substrates and for gene knockout strains, and (3) mapped to the genomes of all available sequenced E. coli strains, including pathogens, leading to the identification of hundreds of unannotated genes in these organisms. Like its predecessors, the {iJO}1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.},

	abstract = {The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (“hierarchical control”) and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of Escherichia coli central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (e.g. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (e.g. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for E. coli and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.},

	abstract = {Application of metabolic engineering principles to the rational design of microbial production processes crucially depends on the ability to describe quantitatively the systemic behavior of the central carbon metabolism to redirect carbon fluxes to the product-forming pathways. Despite the importance for several production processes, development of an essential dynamic model for central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli has been severely hampered by the current lack of kinetic information on the dynamics of the metabolic reactions. Here we present the design and experimental validation of such a dynamic model, which, for the first time, links the sugar transport system (i.e., phosphotransferase system [{PTS}]) with the reactions of glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathway. Experimental observations of intracellular concentrations of metabolites and cometabolites at transient conditions are used to validate the structure of the model and to estimate the kinetic parameters. Further analysis of the detailed characteristics of the system offers the possibility of studying important questions regarding the stability and control of metabolic fluxes.},

	abstract = {A novel mini-scale chemostat system was developed for the physiological characterization of 10-ml cultures. The parallel operation of eight such mini-scale chemostats was exploited for systematic 13C analysis of intracellular fluxes over a broad range of growth rates in glucose-limited Escherichia coli. As expected, physiological variables changed monotonously with the dilution rate, allowing for the assessment of maintenance metabolism. Despite the linear dependence of total cellular carbon influx on dilution rate, the distribution of almost all major fluxes varied nonlinearly with dilution rate. Most prominent were the distinct maximum of glyoxylate shunt activity and the concomitant minimum of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity at low to intermediate dilution rates of 0.05 to 0.2 h−1. During growth on glucose, this glyoxylate shunt activity is best understood from a network perspective as the recently described phosphoenolpyruvate ({PEP})-glyoxylate cycle that oxidizes {PEP} (or pyruvate) to {CO}2. At higher or extremely low dilution rates, in vivo {PEP}-glyoxylate cycle activity was low or absent. The step increase in pentose phosphate pathway activity at around 0.2 h−1 was not related to the cellular demand for the reduction equivalent {NADPH}, since {NADPH} formation was 20 to 50\% in excess of the anabolic demand at all dilution rates. The results demonstrate that mini-scale continuous cultivation enables quantitative and parallel characterization of intra- and extracellular phenotypes in steady state, thereby greatly reducing workload and costs for stable-isotope experiments.},

	abstract = {Glucose pulse experiments at seconds time scale resolution were performed in aerobic glucose-limited Escherichia coli chemostat cultures. The dynamic responses of oxygen-uptake and growth rate at seconds time scale were determined using a new method based on the dynamic liquid-phase mass balance for oxygen and the pseudo-steady-state {ATP} balance. Significant fold changes in metabolites (10–1/10) and fluxes (4–1/4) were observed during the short (200s) period of glucose excess. During glucose excess there was no secretion of by-products and the increased glucose uptake rate led within 40s to a 3.7 fold increase in growth rate. Also within 40–60s a new pseudo-steady-state was reached for both metabolite levels and fluxes. Flux changes of reactions were strongly correlated to the concentrations of involved compounds. Surprisingly the 3.7 fold increase in growth rate and hence protein synthesis rate was not matched by a significant increase in amino acid concentrations. This poses interesting questions for the kinetic factors, which drive protein synthesis by ribosomes.},

The conversion of this metabolic network reconstruction into an in silico model is detailed. A new step in the metabolic reconstruction process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, is introduced, in which reactions were checked for consistency with thermodynamic reversibility estimates. Applications demonstrating the capabilities of the genome-scale metabolic model to predict high-throughput experimental growth and gene deletion phenotypic screens are presented. The increased scope and computational capability using this new reconstruction is expected to broaden the spectrum of both basic biology and applied systems biology studies of E. coli metabolism.},

	abstract = {Quantitative metabolomics of microbial cultures requires well-designed sampling and quenching procedures. We successfully developed and applied a differential method to obtain a reliable set of metabolome data for Escherichia coli K12 {MG}1655 grown in steady-state, aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures. From a rigorous analysis of the commonly applied quenching procedure based on cold aqueous methanol, it was concluded that it was not applicable because of release of a major part of the metabolites from the cells. No positive effect of buffering or increasing the ionic strength of the quenching solution was observed. Application of a differential method in principle requires metabolite measurements in total broth and filtrate for each measurement. Different methods for sampling of culture filtrate were examined, and it was found that direct filtration without cooling of the sample was the most appropriate. Analysis of culture filtrates revealed that most of the central metabolites and amino acids were present in significant amounts outside the cells. Because the turnover time of the pools of extracellular metabolites is much larger than that of the intracellular pools, the differential method should also be applicable to short-term pulse response experiments without requiring measurement of metabolites in the supernatant during the dynamic period.},

	abstract = {Metabolic network models describing growth of Escherichia coli on glucose, glycerol and acetate were derived from a genome scale model of E. coli. One of the uncertainties in the metabolic networks is the exact stoichiometry of energy generating and consuming processes. Accurate estimation of biomass and product yields requires correct information on the {ATP} stoichiometry. The unknown {ATP} stoichiometry parameters of the constructed E. coli network were estimated from experimental data of eight different aerobic chemostat experiments carried out with E. coli {MG}1655, grown at different dilution rates (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 h(-1)) and on different carbon substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetate). Proper estimation of the {ATP} stoichiometry requires proper information on the biomass composition of the organism as well as accurate assessment of net conversion rates under well-defined conditions. For this purpose a growth rate dependent biomass composition was derived, based on measurements and literature data. After incorporation of the growth rate dependent biomass composition in a metabolic network model, an effective P/O ratio of 1.49 +/- 0.26 mol of {ATP}/mol of O, K(X) (growth dependent maintenance) of 0.46 +/- 0.27 mol of {ATP}/C-mol of biomass and m({ATP}) (growth independent maintenance) of 0.075 +/- 0.015 mol of {ATP}/C-mol of biomass/h were estimated using a newly developed Comprehensive Data Reconciliation ({CDR}) method, assuming that the three energetic parameters were independent of the growth rate and the used substrate. The resulting metabolic network model only requires the specific rate of growth, micro, as an input in order to accurately predict all other fluxes and yields.},
