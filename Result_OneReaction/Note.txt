Plots of citramalate productivity against Vmax of enzymes (ACEA to ZWF)

Citramalate productivity defined as:

    mu * (YP/S)
    
        mu = growth rate
        YP/S = (g of product)/(g of substrate)
        
    This is implemented in ecolicitra_copy.ecolicit.comproducti()
    

x axis in multiples of default vmax, unless otherwise stated

Default Vmax is according to the model described in Millard et al (2017)
