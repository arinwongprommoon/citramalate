x axes in multiples of default Vmax

Excludes:
- CITRA_SYN
- GLT
- LPD
- GROWTH
- ATP_MAINTENANCE

because their

    (max - min)/(max + min)
    
values are so high that I can easily see their trends from their plots with
axes adjusted according to CITRA_SYN (see the other directory)

These enzymes have a difference over average ratio lower than 0.01 and likely
negligible (see ../minmax.ods)
