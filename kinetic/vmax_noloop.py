# Runs computations for reactions within a specified list, writes data to CSV
# file. Takes the reaction concerned as an argument.

# This program stops after each reaction and continues on to
# the next reaction when executed again. To run through all reactions, execute
# ./vmax_run.sh . In a nutshell, this script is not very useful on its own
