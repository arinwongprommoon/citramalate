# Runs computations for reactions within a specified list, writes data to TXT
# file, then plots graphs of productivity against multiple of Vmax and saves
# them as image files

# This program stops after each reaction and continues on to
# the next reaction when executed again. To run through all reaction, execute
# ./vmax_run.sh . In a nutshell, this script is not very useful on its own
