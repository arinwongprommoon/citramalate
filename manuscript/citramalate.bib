	abstract = {Background
Isotope labeling experiments ({ILEs}) are increasingly used to investigate the functioning of metabolic systems. Some enzymes are subject to kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}) which modulate reaction rates depending on the isotopic composition of their substrate(s). {KIEs} may therefore affect both the propagation of isotopes through metabolic networks and their operation, and ultimately jeopardize the biological value of {ILEs}. However, the actual impact of {KIEs} on metabolism has never been investigated at the system level.

Results
First, we developed a framework which integrates {KIEs} into kinetic and isotopic models of metabolism, thereby accounting for their system-wide effects on metabolite concentrations, metabolic fluxes, and isotopic patterns. Then, we applied this framework to assess the impact of {KIEs} on the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli in the context of 13C-{ILEs}, under different situations commonly encountered in laboratories. Results showed that the impact of {KIEs} strongly depends on the label input and on the variable considered but is significantly lower than expected intuitively from measurements on isolated enzymes. The global robustness of both the metabolic operation and isotopic patterns largely emerge from intrinsic properties of metabolic networks, such as the distribution of control across the network and bidirectional isotope exchange.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate the necessity of investigating the impact of {KIEs} at the level of the entire system, contradict previous hypotheses that {KIEs} would have a strong effect on isotopic distributions and on flux determination, and strengthen the biological value of 13C-{ILEs}. The proposed modeling framework is generic and can be used to investigate the impact of all the isotopic tracers (2H, 13C, 15N, 18O, etc.) on different isotopic datasets and metabolic systems. By allowing the integration of isotopic and metabolomics data collected under stationary and/or non-stationary conditions, it may also assist interpretations of {ILEs} and facilitate the development of more accurate kinetic models with improved explicative and predictive capabilities.

Jojima, M. Fujii, E. Mori, M. Inui, and H. Yukawa, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 87:159–165, 2010). In this study, we employ stepwise overexpression and chromosomal integration of a total of four genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (herein referred to as glycolytic genes) to demonstrate further successive improvements in C. glutamicum glucose metabolism under oxygen deprivation. In addition to {gapA}, overexpressing pyruvate kinase-encoding pyk and phosphofructokinase-encoding pfk enabled strain {GLY}2/{pCRD}500 to realize respective 13\% and 20\% improved rates of glucose consumption and alanine formation compared to {GLY}1/{pCRD}500. Subsequent overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-encoding gpi in strain {GLY}3/{pCRD}500 further improved its glucose metabolism. Notably, both alanine productivity and yield increased after each overexpression step. After 48 h of incubation, {GLY}3/{pCRD}500 produced 2,430 {mM} alanine at a yield of 91.8\%. This was 6.4-fold higher productivity than that of the wild-type strain. Intracellular metabolite analysis showed that {gapA} overexpression led to a decreased concentration of metabolites upstream of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting that the overexpression resolved a bottleneck in glycolysis. Changing ratios of the extracellular metabolites by overexpression of glycolytic genes resulted in reduction of the intracellular {NADH}/{NAD}+ ratio, which also plays an important role on the improvement of glucose consumption. Enhanced alanine dehydrogenase activity using a high-copy-number plasmid further accelerated the overall alanine productivity. Increase in glycolytic enzyme activities is a promising approach to make drastic progress in growth-arrested bioprocesses.},

On this plasmid, expression of the structural gene for enzyme {IIGlc}, {ptsG}, is controlled by the tac promoter. As expected, the control coefficient (i.e., the relative increase in pathway flux, divided by the relative increase in amount of enzyme) of enzyme {IIGlc} decreased in magnitude if a more extensive pathway was considered. Thus, at the wild-type level of enzyme {IIGlc} activity, the control coefficient of this enzyme on the growth rate on glucose and on the rate of glucose oxidation was low, while the control coefficient on uptake and phosphorylation of methyl alpha-glucopyranoside (an enzyme {IIGlc}-specific, nonmetabolizable glucose analog) was relatively high (0.55 to 0.65). The implications of our findings for {PTS}-mediated regulation, i.e., inhibition of growth on non-{PTS} compounds by glucose, are discussed.},

This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast, first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes, however, were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes, a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed. These findings revealed a new phenomenon, namely the more than additive effects on the flux of simultaneous elevations of several enzyme activities.},

	abstract = {The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (“hierarchical control”) and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of Escherichia coli central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (e.g. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (e.g. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for E. coli and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.},

However, the available methodologies are either impractical, due to a combinatorial explosion in the number of experiments to be performed, or are inaccessible to most experimentalists due to the lack of publicly available, user-friendly software. Although evolutionary algorithms may be employed as alternative approaches to optimize experimental design, the lack of simple-to-use software again restricts their use to specialist practitioners. In addition, the lack of subsidiary approaches to further investigate critical factors and their interactions prevents the full analysis and exploitation of the biotechnological system. We have addressed these problems and, here, provide a simple-to-use and freely available graphical user interface to empower a broad range of experimental biologists to employ complex evolutionary algorithms to optimize their experimental designs. Our approach exploits a Genetic Algorithm to discover the subspace containing the optimal combination of parameters, and Symbolic Regression to construct a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the experiment to each parameter under investigation.

	abstract = {Growth kinetics, i.e., the relationship between specific growth rate and the concentration of a substrate, is one of the basic tools in microbiology. However, despite more than half a century of research, many fundamental questions about the validity and application of growth kinetics as observed in the laboratory to environmental growth conditions are still unanswered. For pure cultures growing with single substrates, enormous inconsistencies exist in the growth kinetic data reported. The low quality of experimental data has so far hampered the comparison and validation of the different growth models proposed, and only recently have data collected from nutrient-controlled chemostat cultures allowed us to compare different kinetic models on a statistical basis. The problems are mainly due to (i) the analytical difficulty in measuring substrates at growth-controlling concentrations and (ii) the fact that during a kinetic experiment, particularly in batch systems, microorganisms alter their kinetic properties because of adaptation to the changing environment. For example, for Escherichia coli growing with glucose, a physiological long-term adaptation results in a change in {KS} for glucose from some 5 mg liter−1 to ca. 30 μg liter−1. The data suggest that a dilemma exists, namely, that either “intrinsic” {KS} (under substrate-controlled conditions in chemostat culture) or μmax (under substrate-excess conditions in batch culture) can be measured but both cannot be determined at the same time. The above-described conventional growth kinetics derived from single-substrate-controlled laboratory experiments have invariably been used for describing both growth and substrate utilization in ecosystems. However, in nature, microbial cells are exposed to a wide spectrum of potential substrates, many of which they utilize simultaneously (in particular carbon sources). The kinetic data available to date for growth of pure cultures in carbon-controlled continuous culture with defined mixtures of two or more carbon sources (including pollutants) clearly demonstrate that simultaneous utilization results in lowered residual steady-state concentrations of all substrates. This should result in a competitive advantage of a cell capable of mixed-substrate growth because it can grow much faster at low substrate concentrations than one would expect from single-substrate kinetics. Additionally, the relevance of the kinetic principles obtained from defined culture systems with single, mixed, or multicomponent substrates to the kinetics of pollutant degradation as it occurs in the presence of alternative carbon sources in complex environmental systems is discussed. The presented overview indicates that many of the environmentally relevant apects in growth kinetics are still waiting to be discovered, established, and exploited.},

Graphical and numerical analysis of the experimental data demonstrated that the application of the Michaelis-Menten equation produced erroneous results, whereas, the constants obtained from the Teissier equation were in agreement with the experimental data. On this basis, new equations defining the steady state cell and substrate concentration in continuous flow cultures were developed and tested against experimental data.Comparison of the specific growth rates, substrate uptake rates and oxygen consumption rates demonstrated that all were directly proportional to each other and could be related to each other by mathematical equations. Specifically it was shown that as the growth rate increased from 0.06 to k m =0.76 the substrate uptake rate increased from 134 to 1420 mg glucose per gram cell weight per hour and the oxygen consumption rate increased from 48.6 to 505 mg O2 per gram cell weight per hour. Independent of the growth rate 37\% of the carbohydrate consumed were oxidized. The yield factor varied from 0.44 at low growth rates to 0.54 at high growth rates. Analysis of the growth rate-substrate uptake rate relationship indicated that a minimum substrate uptake rate of 55 mg glucose per gram cell weight per hour existed below which cell reproduction would cease. This was supported by the fact that steady state conditions could not be maintained in the culture at D values below 0.02 when the substrate supply rate decreased below 45 mg glucose per gram cell weight per hour.},

	abstract = {Metabolic network models describing growth of Escherichia coli on glucose, glycerol and acetate were derived from a genome scale model of E. coli. One of the uncertainties in the metabolic networks is the exact stoichiometry of energy generating and consuming processes. Accurate estimation of biomass and product yields requires correct information on the {ATP} stoichiometry. The unknown {ATP} stoichiometry parameters of the constructed E. coli network were estimated from experimental data of eight different aerobic chemostat experiments carried out with E. coli {MG}1655, grown at different dilution rates (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 h(-1)) and on different carbon substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetate). Proper estimation of the {ATP} stoichiometry requires proper information on the biomass composition of the organism as well as accurate assessment of net conversion rates under well-defined conditions. For this purpose a growth rate dependent biomass composition was derived, based on measurements and literature data. After incorporation of the growth rate dependent biomass composition in a metabolic network model, an effective P/O ratio of 1.49 +/- 0.26 mol of {ATP}/mol of O, K(X) (growth dependent maintenance) of 0.46 +/- 0.27 mol of {ATP}/C-mol of biomass and m({ATP}) (growth independent maintenance) of 0.075 +/- 0.015 mol of {ATP}/C-mol of biomass/h were estimated using a newly developed Comprehensive Data Reconciliation ({CDR}) method, assuming that the three energetic parameters were independent of the growth rate and the used substrate. The resulting metabolic network model only requires the specific rate of growth, micro, as an input in order to accurately predict all other fluxes and yields.},

We successfully developed and applied a differential method to obtain a reliable set of metabolome data for Escherichia coli K12 {MG}1655 grown in steady-state, aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures. From a rigorous analysis of the commonly applied quenching procedure based on cold aqueous methanol, it was concluded that it was not applicable because of release of a major part of the metabolites from the cells. No positive effect of buffering or increasing the ionic strength of the quenching solution was observed. Application of a differential method in principle requires metabolite measurements in total broth and filtrate for each measurement. Different methods for sampling of culture filtrate were examined, and it was found that direct filtration without cooling of the sample was the most appropriate. Analysis of culture filtrates revealed that most of the central metabolites and amino acids were present in significant amounts outside the cells. Because the turnover time of the pools of extracellular metabolites is much larger than that of the intracellular pools, the differential method should also be applicable to short-term pulse response experiments without requiring measurement of metabolites in the supernatant during the dynamic period.},

Significant fold changes in metabolites (10–1/10) and fluxes (4–1/4) were observed during the short (200s) period of glucose excess. During glucose excess there was no secretion of by-products and the increased glucose uptake rate led within 40s to a 3.7 fold increase in growth rate. Also within 40–60s a new pseudo-steady-state was reached for both metabolite levels and fluxes. Flux changes of reactions were strongly correlated to the concentrations of involved compounds. Surprisingly the 3.7 fold increase in growth rate and hence protein synthesis rate was not matched by a significant increase in amino acid concentrations.

The parallel operation of eight such mini-scale chemostats was exploited for systematic 13C analysis of intracellular fluxes over a broad range of growth rates in glucose-limited Escherichia coli. As expected, physiological variables changed monotonously with the dilution rate, allowing for the assessment of maintenance metabolism. Despite the linear dependence of total cellular carbon influx on dilution rate, the distribution of almost all major fluxes varied nonlinearly with dilution rate. Most prominent were the distinct maximum of glyoxylate shunt activity and the concomitant minimum of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity at low to intermediate dilution rates of 0.05 to 0.2 h−1. During growth on glucose, this glyoxylate shunt activity is best understood from a network perspective as the recently described phosphoenolpyruvate ({PEP})-glyoxylate cycle that oxidizes {PEP} (or pyruvate) to {CO}2. At higher or extremely low dilution rates, in vivo {PEP}-glyoxylate cycle activity was low or absent. The step increase in pentose phosphate pathway activity at around 0.2 h−1 was not related to the cellular demand for the reduction equivalent {NADPH}, since {NADPH} formation was 20 to 50\% in excess of the anabolic demand at all dilution rates. The results demonstrate that mini-scale continuous cultivation enables quantitative and parallel characterization of intra- and extracellular phenotypes in steady state, thereby greatly reducing workload and costs for stable-isotope experiments.},

Here we present the design and experimental validation of such a dynamic model, which, for the first time, links the sugar transport system (i.e., phosphotransferase system [{PTS}]) with the reactions of glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathway. Experimental observations of intracellular concentrations of metabolites and cometabolites at transient conditions are used to validate the structure of the model and to estimate the kinetic parameters.

Once the modified differential evolutions are presented, a large comparative analysis is performed with the aim to assess both correctness and efficiency of the proposed operators. Advantages of proposed {DEA} are used in an important task of modern structural engineering that is mechanical identification under external dynamic loads. This is because of the importance of using a “parameters-less” algorithm in identification problems whose characteristics typically vary strongly case by case, needing of a continuous set up of the algorithm proposed. This important advantage of proposed optimizers, in front of other identification algorithms, is used to develop a computer code suitable for the automatic identification of a simple supported beam subject to an impact load, that has been tested both using numerical simulations and real standard tests dynamic. The results point out that this algorithm is an interesting candidate for standard applications in structural identification problems.},

	abstract = {Background
{COnstraint}-Based Reconstruction and Analysis ({COBRA}) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply {COBRA} methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The {COBRA} Toolbox for {MATLAB} is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The {openCOBRA} Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software.

Results
Here, we describe {COBRA} for Python ({COBRApy}), a Python package that provides support for basic {COBRA} methods. {COBRApy} is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. {COBRApy} does not require {MATLAB} to function; however, it includes an interface to the {COBRA} Toolbox for {MATLAB} to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance, {COBRApy} includes parallel processing support for computationally intensive processes.

Conclusion
{COBRApy} is an object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational challenges associated with the next generation of stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

{RESULTS}: {libRoadRunner} is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface ({API}) is similar to the {APIs} of {MATLAB} ( {WWWMATHWORKSCOM}: ) and {SciPy} ( {HTTP}//{WWWSCIPYORG}/: ), making it fast and easy to learn. {libRoadRunner} uses a custom Just-In-Time ({JIT}) compiler built on the widely used {LLVM} {JIT} compiler framework. It compiles {SBML}-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. {libRoadRunner} is flexible, supporting the bulk of the {SBML} specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several {SBML} extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix.
{AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: {libRoadRunner} binary distributions are available for Mac {OS} X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. {libRoadRunner} is also available for {ARM}-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository.

	abstract = {({EN}) The present invention provides a process for the biological production of the key industrial chemical methacrylic acid and various derivatives thereof including methyl methacrylate. The method comprises using biological pathways to produce mesaconic acid or citraconic acid or citramalic acid, which acids are then decarboxylated to produce methacrylic acid. The acids are substantially non-toxic to cells allowing a viable biobased route to key monomers to be realised. Therefore the invention potentially alleviates the problem of using fossil fuel resources in that it provides an alternative method to form methacrylic acid.({FR}) La présente invention concerne un procédé pour la production biologique de la substance chimique industrielle clé acide méthacrylique et de différents dérivés de celui-ci comprenant le méthacrylate de méthyle.

Each perspective adds its contribution to the understanding of the system, thus the three approaches do not compete, but complement each other. We illustrate our approach by applying it to an extended model of the three stage cascade, which forms the core of the {ERK} signal transduction pathway. Consequently our focus is on transient behaviour analysis. We demonstrate how qualitative descriptions are abstractions over stochastic or continuous descriptions, and show that the stochastic and continuous models approximate each other. A key contribution of the paper consists in a precise definition of biochemically interpreted stochastic Petri nets. Although our framework is based on Petri nets, it can be applied more widely to other formalisms which are used to model and analyse biochemical networks.},

	abstract = {Background
The efficacy of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis has been shown to be influenced by experimental media conditions. Investigations of M. tuberculosis growth in physiological conditions have described an environment that is different from common in vitro media. Thus, elucidating the interplay between available nutrient sources and antibiotic efficacy has clear medical relevance. While genome-scale reconstructions of M. tuberculosis have enabled the ability to interrogate media differences for the past 10 years, recent reconstructions have diverged from each other without standardization. A unified reconstruction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv would elucidate the impact of different nutrient conditions on antibiotic efficacy and provide new insights for therapeutic intervention.

Results
We present a new genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, named {iEK}1011, that unifies and updates previous M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome-scale reconstructions. We functionally assess {iEK}1011 against previous models and show that the model increases correct gene essentiality predictions on two different experimental datasets by 6\% (53\% to 60\%) and 18\% (60\% to 71\%), respectively. We compared simulations between in vitro and approximated in vivo media conditions to examine the predictive capabilities of {iEK}1011. The simulated differences recapitulated literature defined characteristics in the rewiring of {TCA} metabolism including succinate secretion, gluconeogenesis, and activation of both the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. To assist efforts to elucidate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development, we curated 16 metabolic genes related to antimicrobial resistance and approximated evolutionary drivers of resistance. Comparing simulations of these antibiotic resistance features between in vivo and in vitro media highlighted condition-dependent differences that may influence the efficacy of antibiotics.

Conclusions
{iEK}1011 provides a computational knowledge base for exploring the impact of different environmental conditions on the metabolic state of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. As more experimental data and knowledge of M. tuberculosis H37Rv become available, a unified and standardized M. tuberculosis model will prove to be a valuable resource to the research community studying the systems biology of M. tuberculosis.

Here we present a model for continuous cell culture coupling intra-cellular metabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor, taking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation. We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. The ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by a negative feedback loop due to toxic byproduct accumulation. A complex landscape of steady states emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced.},

They have thus largely been analyzed with computationally efficient constraint-based methods such as flux-balance analysis, limiting their scope and phenotype prediction accuracy. Computationally more demanding but potentially more informative methods, such as kinetic and dynamic modeling, are currently limited to small or medium-sized models. Thus, it is desirable to achieve unbiased stoichiometric reductions of large-scale metabolic models to small, coarse-grained model representations that capture significant metabolic modules. Here, we review published automated and semiautomated methods used for large-scale metabolic model reduction. The top-down methods discussed provide minimal networks that retain a set of user-protected phenotypes, but may reduce the model’s metabolic and phenotypic versatility. In contrast, the two bottom-up approaches reviewed retain a more unbiased set of phenotypes; at the same time, these methods require the partitioning of the {GSM} into metabolic subsystems by the user, and make strong assumptions on the subsystems’ connections and their states, respectively.},
